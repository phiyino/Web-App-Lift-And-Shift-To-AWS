# Web-App-Lift-And-Shift-To-AWS
The project involves the seamless migration of a Java web application to the cloud, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) through Terraform. By adopting this approach, the project aims to efficiently "lift and shift" the existing web application from its on-premises environment to a modern and scalable cloud infrastructure. Terraform, a versatile IaaC tool, will facilitate the provisioning of AWS resources such as virtual machines, networking components, and storage, while ensuring the entire infrastructure setup is reproducible, version-controlled, and easily manageable. Through this undertaking, the project seeks to achieve enhanced scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness for the Java web application, all while streamlining the deployment process and minimizing operational complexities.
